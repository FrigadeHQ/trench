<Steps>
  <Step title="Deploy Trench">
   The only prerequisite for Trench is a system that has Docker and Docker Compose installed [see installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). We recommend having at least 4GB of RAM and 4 CPU cores for optimal performance if you're running a production environment.

After installing Docker, you can start the local development server by running the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/frigadehq/trench.git
cd trench/apps/trench
cp .env.example .env
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build --force-recreate --renew-anon-volumes
```

The above command will start the Trench server that includes a local ClickHouse and Kafka instance on `http://localhost:4000`. You can update the `.env` to change any of the configuration options.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Send a sample event">
   You can find and update the default public and private API key in the `.env` file. Using your public API key, you can send a sample event to Trench as such:

    ```bash
    curl -i -X POST \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer public-d613be4e-di03-4b02-9058-70aa4j04ff28" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d \
    '{
      "events": [
        {
          "userId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
          "type": "track",
          "event": "ConnectedAccount",
          "properties": {
            "totalAccounts": 4,
            "country": "Denmark"
          }
        }]
    }' \
     'http://localhost:4000/events'
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Quering events">
    You can query events using the `/events` endpoint (see [API reference](/api-reference/events-get) for more details).

You can also query events directly from your local Trench server. For example, to query events of type `ConnectedAccount`, you can use the following URL:

```bash
curl -i -X GET \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer private-d613be4e-di03-4b02-9058-70aa4j04ff28" \
   'http://localhost:4000/events?event=ConnectedAccount'
```

This will return a JSON response with the event that was just sent:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "uuid": "25f7c712-dd86-4db0-89a8-d07d11b73e57",
      "type": "track",
      "event": "ConnectedAccount",
      "userId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
      "properties": {
        "totalAccounts": 4,
        "country": "Denmark"
      },
      "timestamp": "2024-10-22T19:34:56.000Z",
      "parsedAt": "2024-10-22T19:34:59.530Z"
    }
  ],
  "limit": 1000,
  "offset": 0,
  "total": 1
}
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Execute raw SQL queries">
    Use the queries endpoint to analyze your data.  Example:

    ```bash
    curl -i -X POST \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer private-d613be4e-di03-4b02-9058-70aa4j04ff28" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d \
    '{
      "query": "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM events WHERE userId = '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000'"
    }' \
     'http://localhost:4000/queries'
    ```

    Sample query result:

    ```json
    {
      "count": 5
    }
    ```

## Going Further

While the above steps are a great starting point, the following video tutorial exemplifies the many things you can do with Trench. In this video, we build a mini version of Google Analytics using Trench and Grafana:
