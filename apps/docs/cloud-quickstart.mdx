import TrenchScript from '/snippets/trench-script.mdx';

In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of sending your first event and reading it back using the Trench Cloud API.
The example uses the [Trench JavaScript client](https://github.com/trench-dev/trench-js), but the same can be achieved by calling the [Events API](https://docs.trench.dev/api-reference/events-create) directly.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request Access to Trench Cloud">
    To get started with Trench Cloud, you need to request access from our [website](https://trench.dev?utm_campaign=cloud-quickstart). Once you have access, you will receive your API keys and other necessary credentials.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Trench JavaScript Client">
    First, you need to install the Trench JavaScript client using your favorite package manager:

    ```bash
    npm install trench-js
    ```

    Alternatively, you can use the CDN version and skip the **Initialize the Client** step:

    <TrenchScript />

  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize the Client">
    After installing the client, you need to initialize it with your API key. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` and `YOUR_SERVER_URL` with the actual API key and server URL you received:

    ```javascript
    import Trench from 'trench-js'

    const trench = new Trench({
      publicApiKey: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_API_KEY',
      serverUrl: 'YOUR_SERVER_URL'
    });
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Send a Sample Event">
    Now you can send a sample event to Trench Cloud. Here is an example of how to send an event:

    ```javascript
    trench.track({
      userId: '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000',
      event: 'ConnectedAccount',
      properties: {
        totalAccounts: 4,
        country: 'Denmark'
      }
    }).then(response => {
      console.log('Event sent successfully:', response);
    }).catch(error => {
      console.error('Error sending event:', error);
    });
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the Event">
    You can verify that the event was received by querying the events endpoint. Use your private API key for this:

    ```bash
    curl -i -X GET \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer private-YOUR_PRIVATE_API_KEY" \
       'YOUR_SERVER_URL/events?event=ConnectedAccount'
    ```

    This will return a JSON response with the event that was just sent.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Going Further

Now that you've sent your first event, you can learn more about the many things you can do with Trench.
